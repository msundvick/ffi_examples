# Python FFI

Examples of simple build systems for compiling code in python.
The examples here should be robust and able to be compiled into python wheels for easy distribution, using nothing but `poetry build`.
At least, that's the idea. I've confirmed `poetry install` will work, but need to check files end up in wheels properly.
